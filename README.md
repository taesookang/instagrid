# Instagrid

Instagram is one of the most frequently used apps for me, and I often thought about cloning it when I used the app. Although there were already a plenty of Instagram cloned app built by other developers, I wanted to build my own version of the app with detailed UI cloning, utilizing my own logic and abilities to solve problems. Here is the outcome.

## Stacks
- Next JS
- Typescript 
- Tailwind CSS + SCSS
- Firebase 9
- Figma (for logos & icons design)

## What I learned from this project
The biggest mistake I made during building this app was not to take enough time for structurizing data. It occured hundreds errors of course, therefore I needed to spend more time for debugging and changing types. The most important lesson I learned from this project is that the more time for planning the less time for debugging. 

- How to use **debounced value** for searching query.
- Concepts of **cookie and session** and when to use them. 
- How to make and import **svg icons** from Figma and turn them into **react components**. 
- Animating UI building with Tailwind CSS.
- Best practice of **Firebase 9** authentication & admin SDK, firestore, storage.
